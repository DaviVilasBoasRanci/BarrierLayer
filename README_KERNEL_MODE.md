# BarrierLayer - Advanced System Security & Anti-Cheat for Linux Gaming (Kernel-Mode)

![BarrierLayer Logo Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/150x50?text=BarrierLayer+Kernel-Mode+Logo) <!-- Replace with actual logo -->

## üõ°Ô∏è A Comprehensive Kernel-Mode Solution for Linux Gamers üéÆ

This is the advanced, kernel-mode implementation of BarrierLayer, designed to provide unparalleled compatibility and security for Linux users running Windows games, especially those with challenging anti-cheat software. By operating directly within the Linux kernel, this version eliminates the limitations of user-mode `LD_PRELOAD` techniques, offering superior stealth and control.

## ‚ú® Objective

In the evolving landscape of Linux gaming, anti-cheat solutions often pose significant barriers. This advanced BarrierLayer aims to provide a robust, transparent, and configurable framework that:

*   **Enables Anti-Cheat Compatibility:** Allows games with aggressive anti-cheat systems (like EAC, BattlEye, Vanguard) to run on Linux by operating at a higher privilege level than the anti-cheats themselves.
*   **Ensures System Integrity:** Provides a deep layer of security and monitoring to protect the system from potentially intrusive game anti-cheat mechanisms.
*   **Enhances User Experience:** Offers a smoother and more reliable gaming experience for titles traditionally confined to Windows, without relying on easily detectable user-mode hacks.

## üöÄ Features

This kernel-mode BarrierLayer achieves its goals through a multi-faceted approach, leveraging advanced kernel-level interventions:

*   **Exclusive Kernel-Mode Operation:** All critical anti-cheat evasion logic resides within the Linux kernel, making it significantly harder to detect from user-mode.
*   **No `LD_PRELOAD`:** Completely eliminates the use of `LD_PRELOAD`, removing a primary and easily detectable vector for anti-cheats.
*   **Advanced Syscall Hooking:** Intercepts and modifies critical system calls (e.g., `openat`, `execve`, `getdents64`, `ptrace`, `mmap`) to mask BarrierLayer's presence, hide processes, and manipulate application behavior.
*   **Stealth and Anti-Detection:** Implements techniques such as kernel module hiding, process/file hiding, string obfuscation, and anti-debugging measures to remain undetected by sophisticated anti-cheat solutions.
*   **Robust Code Injection:** Utilizes kernel-assisted mechanisms for injecting code directly into target processes, ensuring reliability and stealth without relying on `LD_PRELOAD`.
*   **Advanced Logging:** Features a stealthy, obfuscated in-kernel logging system for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Configurable Launcher (`stealth_launcher`):** A new user-mode launcher that orchestrates the entire process, communicating directly with the kernel module.
*   **Automated Management Script (`advanced_launcher.sh`):** A convenient bash script for loading/unloading the kernel module and launching applications with BarrierLayer protections.
